Electronic sensitive document storage

Final year project. Aims to make storage of legal documents electronically a possiblity using new technologies.
Storage is now cheaper due to Amazon Glacier. This project will build upon Glacier to make a polished replacement 
for the current expensive/insecure file archives held by many legal organisations.

Things to consider:
  Security (number 1)
  Usefulness of supplying documents to local authority after required period of retention
  Cost effectiveness
  Scalability
  Compliance with rules and regulations (Data protection act etc.)

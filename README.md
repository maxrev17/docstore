Electronic sensitive document storage

Final year project. Aims to make storage of legal documents electronically a possiblity using new technologies.
Storage is now cheaper due to Amazon Glacier. This project will build upon Glacier to make a polished replacement 
for the current expensive/insecure file archives held by many legal organisations.
